# Tokyo 24/7 Image Retrieval Annotations
## Introduction

To help visual-geolocalization research, we publish a subset of manually annotated Tokyo 24/7 Google Street View Dataset originally released by Torii *et al* [[1]](#1).  There are no explicit ground truths provided in the dataset, and generally the provided GPS locations are used to select ground truths for image retrieval applications. 

In this work, we annotate a subset of the original Tokyo 24/7 Dataset following a similar convention as Oxford5k [[2]](#2) and Paris6k [[3]](#3) datasets.  The annotated subset consists of 16,000 dataset images and 49 distinct query locations taken at day/evening/night, resulting in a total of 147 query images.



## Annotation Process

1. The query subset used in [[1]](#1) was used as the base. The csv files were collated into one large csv file so the number of queries in each easting could be determined.
2. The top three eastings with the most query images were picked: 03819XX, 03821XX, 03822XX, and a query-csv specific to each easting was generated. This csv contains the coordinates of each image.
3. image-csv's were then generated for the dataset images within these three eastings.
4. By comparing the coordinates between query and dataset images of the same easting, .txt files containing potential positives for each query are generated.
5. The .txt files are manually reviewed and annotated to determine positives and junks.
